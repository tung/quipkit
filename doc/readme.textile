The Quipkit engine runs your game, once you've written code for it. These packages will help you do just that.

High-level packages:

* "sfont.lua":doc/sfont.textile - drawing text with bitmap glyphs

Low-level packages:

* "gl":http://luagl.sourceforge.net/ - OpenGL bindings for Lua
* "sdl":http://luaforge.net/projects/luasdl/ - Kein-Hong Man's SDL bindings for Lua (with SDL_image, SDL_net and SDL_ttf)
* "sdlgl.lua":doc/sdlgl.textile - support for using SDL with OpenGL
