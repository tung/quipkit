h1. Building Quipkit

First visit the GitHub project page and click "Download Source" at the top-right.

h2. For Windows

Grab the Code::Blocks + MinGW combo from the Code::Blocks website.

Open @quipkit.workspace@. Build the "Quipkit Engine" project for the engine, and "Quipkit Editor" for the editor. Both can be run within the IDE.

h2. For Linux

Grab these development libs for the engine:

* ALSA
* libpng
* Lua 5.1
* OpenGL
* SDL, SDL_image, SDL_net and SDL_ttf

Grab these development libs for the editor:

* Lua 5.1
* Tcl and Tk 8.5

Type @make@, then try running the engine with @./game@ and the editor with @./edit@.

h2. Trying the Demos

After making the engine, you can try some of the demos in the @test/@ directory. Here's a few:

<pre><code>./game test/audio.lua
./game test/animate.lua
./game test/audioscale.lua
./game test/blitpng.lua
./game test/gametest.lua
./game test/smile.lua
</code></pre>

If you're on a command line, @./game test/key.lua@ also demonstrates keyboard input.

The easiest way to try these demos on Windows is by editing @main.lua@.
