h1. Quipkit Code Conventions

This is mostly for C code.

h2. Names

* Functions - CaptialCase
** Convert acronyms too, e.g. Sdl instead of SDL
* Macros - ALL_CAPS
* Constants - ALL_CAPS
* Typedefs - CapitalCase
* Variables - underscore_separated
** Global variables - g_prefixed
** Module variables - m_prefixed
* Scoping/namespacing - prefixed_

h2. Spacing

* Indentation - 4 spaces
* Line spacing
** 3 lines between logical sections in a file
** 2 lines between functions
** 1 line between a function and its data
** 1 line within functions when needed
* Commas - 1 space after, but not before, like in English prose
* Operators
** Binary - 1 space before and after, e.g. 1 + 2, not 1+2
** Unary - no space, e.g. ++i
* Braces
** Always use them
** Opening brace on the same line
** Closing brace flush with indentation immediately outside

h2. Headers

* "main" header first
** e.g. blah.c should include blah.h before anything else
* 1 blank line
* System/library headers in alphabetical order
* 1 blank line
* Any other headers in alphabetical order

The order of headers can be different if it's needed for compilation or features.
