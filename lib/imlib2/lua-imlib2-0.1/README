Description:
  Provides a mostly complete binding to the imlib2 image manipulation library.  
  You will need these libraries installed in order to use lua-imlib2 
  (preferably a recent version). This release makes no effort to wrap the X11 
  related Imlib2 functionality, but aims to support all other features. The 
  API is fully documented. If you encounter any problems or have  any 
  suggestions (or patches) then please contact me through the website listed 
  above.
