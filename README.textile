h1. Quipkit

Quipkit is a 2D JRPG engine for programmers. It works on Windows and Linux.

Unlike most RPG engines, Quipkit's editor lets you create custom tools and scripts, meaning that making lots of content becomes much easier if you invest your time wisely.

The way of Quipkit is divided into game states on a stack (called _gamelets_), assets, and the custom tools/scripts used to make said assets.


h2. Status

The engine builds on both Windows and Linux: see the build instructions at doc/build.textile. It's nearly done.

The editor, on the other hand, is little more than a "hello world" dialog box right now. I'm working on it, honest.
