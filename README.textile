h1. Quipkit

Hi, I'm Tung, and this is Quipkit.

Quipkit is the _programmer's RPG kit_. With it, you can make 2D SNES-era role-playing games.

Making RPGs is harder than making other kinds of games:

* more _code_ needs to be written
* more _state_ needs to be kept
* more _content_ needs to be made

Split your RPG's code into modules with the **gamelet framework**. Save, load and tidy up your state with the **persistence framework**. Make and use **custom tools** that help you and your team make an RPG that stands out from the rest.


h2. Building Quipkit

First visit the GitHub project page and click "Download Source" at the top-right.

h3. For Windows

Grab the Code::Blocks + MinGW combo from the Code::Blocks website.

Open @quipkit.workspace@. Build the "Quipkit Engine" project for the engine, and "Quipkit Editor" for the editor. Both can be run within the IDE.

h3. For Linux

Grab these development libs for the engine:

* ALSA
* libpng
* Lua 5.1
* OpenGL
* SDL, SDL_image, SDL_net and SDL_ttf

Grab these development libs for the editor:

* Lua 5.1
* Tcl and Tk 8.5

Type @make@, then try running the engine with @./game@ and the editor with @./edit@.

h3. Trying the Demos

After making the engine, you can try some of the demos in the @test/@ directory. Here's a few:

<pre><code>./game test/audio.lua
./game test/animate.lua
./game test/audioscale.lua
./game test/blitpng.lua
./game test/gametest.lua
./game test/smile.lua
</code></pre>

If you're on a command line, @./game test/key.lua@ also demonstrates keyboard input.

The easiest way to try these demos on Windows is by editing @main.lua@.


h2. Status

Running the engine shows a yellow animated character that constantly walks down the screen. Running the editor shows a small "hello world" dialog box.

The basic game and sprite libs are done. The gamelet framework and font lib are nearly done. Persistence and tool support are still to come.

These low-level libs are integrated and stable:

* Engine
** Input handling and image loading via SDL
** Graphics with OpenGL
** Audio with proteaAudio

* Editor
** GUI support via Tcl and Tk 8.5
