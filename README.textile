h1. Quipkit

Hi, I'm Tung, and this is Quipkit.

Quipkit is the _programmer's RPG kit_. With it, you can make 2D SNES-era role-playing games.

Making RPGs is harder than making other kinds of games:

* more _code_ needs to be written
* more _state_ needs to be kept
* more _content_ needs to be made

Split your RPG's code into modules with the **gamelet framework**. Save, load and tidy up your state with the **persistence framework**. Make and use **custom tools** that help you and your team make an RPG that stands out from the rest.


h2. Status

The engine and editor can be "built":quipkit/doc/build.textile for Windows and Linux.

Running the engine shows a yellow animated character that constantly walks down the screen. Running the editor shows a small "hello world" dialog box.

The basic game and sprite libs are done. The gamelet framework and font lib are nearly done. Persistence and tool support are still to come.

These low-level libs are integrated and stable:

* Engine
** Input handling and image loading via SDL
** Graphics with OpenGL
** Audio with proteaAudio

* Editor
** GUI support via Tcl and Tk 8.5
