h1. Quipkit

Hi, I'm Tung, and I'm making this new game engine/editor combo called *Quipkit*.

Quipkit is a computer role-playing game dev kit for the little guy. It was born as a newer alternative to the aging "Sphere RPG Engine":http://www.spheredev.org/, which provides tools and a programming platform to help create SNES-era RPGs.


h2. Status

*Quipkit is in its early days. It's not in any releasable state.*

Right now, Quipkit builds as a basic game engine with some SDL, OpenGL and libpng bindings. It can build on Linux and Windows. Running it should show a yellow smiley face for a few seconds before closing.

If you're still here, chances are you know me and want to see my code, or you're interested in helping me work on it. In either case, welcome!


h2. The Indie RPG Problem

RPGs are notorious in indie game dev circles for being rare to find, hard to make and of dubious quality if they're ever finished.

Making RPGs differs from making other kinds of games:

* Much more *content* is needed.
** Players go through it much quicker.
** Players expect the game to be long.
* Much more *state* needs maintaining.
** Players expect many branching paths.
** Testing takes a lot longer.
* RPGs are like *several games* influencing each other.
** Map exploration meets combat meets money/stat management meets puzzle meets etc.
** And they _all_ have to be fun if the RPG is not to suck!

In short, there's more _everything_! Today's tools won't cut it.


h2. The Quipkit Answer

Quipkit aims to help you make that "more everything" in your quest to make the next indie RPG.

The *game engine* runs on "Lua":http://www.lua.org/, a simple, powerful, gets-out-of-your-way scripting language to help keep your code under control. With Lua's power, handling all that state and those mini-game systems should be a snap!

The Quipkit *editor*, also (to be) Lua-powered, gives you the power to make and tweak RPG content faster than ever with _tools_. You can script your own and use others'. Writing, drawing and directing your RPG can be streamlined, by yourself or with the help of your computer programming buddies.


h2. Building Quipkit

Right now only the engine is available.

h3. On Linux

Install the development libs for:

* OpenGL
* SDL
* libpng
* Lua 5.1

Then type @make@. Enter @./quipkit@ to try it out.

h3. On Windows

Install the Code::Blocks + MinGW combo from the Code::Blocks website.

Open @quipkit.workspace@ and build the "Quipkit" project, which should build the "sdl" and "png" libraries as well. Run it from the IDE to try it out.
