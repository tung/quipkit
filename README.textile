h1. Quipkit

Hi, I'm Tung, and this is Quipkit.

Quipkit is the _programmer's RPG kit_. With it, you can make 2D SNES-era role-playing games.

Making RPGs is harder than making other kinds of games:

* more _code_ needs to be written
* more _state_ needs to be kept
* more _content_ needs to be made

Split your RPG's code into modules with the **game state framework**. Save, load and tidy up your state with the **persistence framework**. Make and use **custom tools** that help you and your team make an RPG that stands out from the rest.


h2. Status

Sorry, but those awesome things I just told you about aren't done just yet.

Here's what is:

* Lua-powered game engine core
** Input handling with SDL
** Graphics with OpenGL
** PNG images
** Audio with proteaAudio

* Lua-powered editor core
** GUI support via Tcl and Tk 8.5

Running the engine shows a yellow animated character that constantly walks down the screen.

Running the editor shows a small "hello world" dialog box.

No unified API yet, but all the low-level core libs are there, super-stable and ready for use by anyone.


h2. Building Quipkit

After you build the engine, try out some of the funky demos in the @test/@ directory.

h3. For Windows

Grab the Code::Blocks + MinGW combo from the Code::Blocks website.

Open @quipkit.workspace@. Build the "Quipkit Engine" project for the engine, and "Quipkit Editor" for the editor. Both can be run within the IDE.

h3. For Linux

Grab these development libs for the engine:

* ALSA
* libpng
* Lua 5.1
* OpenGL
* SDL

Grab these development libs for the editor:

* Lua 5.1
* Tcl 8.5
* Tk 8.5

Type @make@, then try running the engine with @./game@ and the editor with @./edit@.
