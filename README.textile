h1. Quipkit

Quipkit is an RPG kit for programmers. It runs on Lua, SDL and OpenGL, and works on Windows and Linux.


h2. Rationale

Quipkit aims to solve the same problem as "Sphere":http://spheredev.org/ : how to help people make RPGs. Sphere does it by:

* giving tools to make assets,
* having a pre-made engine and formats to quickly make a prototype, and
* letting those be customised to evolve the prototype into a finished RPG.

Sphere's problem is that its pre-made engine and formats contain many quirks, making that last part impossible for newbies and frustrating for programmers.

Why not just make a quirk-free engine and formats then? Quirks exist when features don't work the way they're expected to, and everybody has different expectations for their games. There are several responses to this:

* Make a fully-featured engine. Sphere did this, but couldn't avoid its fate, even though it was made by skilled programmers.
* Make a small engine and ignore feature requests. This isn't useful to people who need those features, and takes focus away from making a solid foundation.
* Have people make their own engine on top of a solid foundation for completing RPGs.

Quipkit opts for the last approach. It aims to be a small, solid layer of game essentials like input, graphics and sound over the OS, good not only for making an RPG, but also the tools along the way.
